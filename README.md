Steps:

1. First clone the repository from Github and switch to the new directory:
```
  $ git clone git@github.com/USERNAME/<project_name>.git

  $ cd <project_name>
```
2. Open any IDE.
   
3. Set the date in the below code to predict the count of vehicles for that day:

```
#testing
print('Prediction: ', m1.predict([[11,6,4,1,2015,11,2]])) //set the desired date here
```
 
4. Go to Terminal open the project folder.

5. Run the program.

```
  python count_vehicle.py
```
6. You can see the result like below.

```
Prediction:  [8.32]
//approximately equal to 8 vehicles on the given date as per the prediction
```
